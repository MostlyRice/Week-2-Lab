        <h2>Favorite Movie</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite movie of all time has to be <span id="favorite-movie-title">Dark Knight</span>  by Christopher Nolan.
            I think one of the things that holds this movie up today is because the movie
            is the most grounded and brilliant take on a real-life interpretation of Batman.
            This remains one of my favorite "superhero" movies, mostly because it's one of the few that doesn't actually feel like a superhero movie.

        <h2>My Favorite Band/Artist</h2>
        <p>
            I think the greatest of all time musician has to be <span id="favorite-music-name">Kendrick Lamar</span>.
            He has various perfected skills as a rapper: storytelling, complex writing and rhymes, rich vocabulary, original music, can alter his voice to express emotions, contextual music, musical genius, artistic genius etc. He is absolutely on another level amongst his peers. Without a doubt the one of the greatest lyricists of all time and has the music to back his message.
